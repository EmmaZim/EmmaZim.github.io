        Optimizing Containerfiles (Software Engineering I)
        <br>   January 2023 - May 2023
    </b>
    <ul>
        Developed a product to aid software developers by automating the process of containerization. The application allows users to create a
        container, import files in the container, create systems, and connect systems and containers. The product will then
        optimize all of the Containerfiles in the system and output these optimizations in a text file.
    </ul>
    <ul>
        This application consists of three main components: Graphical User Interface, Database, and Optimization Script.
    </ul>
    <ul>
        This product is a Windows form application that was developed in C# using Microsoft .NET.
        Microsoft .NET was utilized to create a local database and ADO .NET was used to facilitate all of the interactions between the application and the database.
        Classroom presentation and demonstration to sponsor Lockheed Martin Corporation. Agile role - Product Owner.
